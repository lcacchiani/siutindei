"""API Gateway request authorizer for partner API keys.

This Lambda validates the ``x-partner-key`` header against hashed keys
stored in the ``api_keys`` table (read via RDS Proxy with IAM auth) and
passes the key identity (id, scope, organization) to the backend handlers.

Unlike the JWT authorizers, this function runs INSIDE the VPC because it
needs database access instead of public JWKS endpoints.
