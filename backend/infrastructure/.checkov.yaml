# Checkov configuration for CDK infrastructure
# All checkov skips should be centralized in this file
# See: https://www.checkov.io/2.Basics/Suppressing%20and%20Skipping%20Policies.html

# Framework configuration
framework:
  - cloudformation

# Soft fail - report issues without failing the build
soft-fail: true

# Skip checks - add justification for each skipped check
# Format:
#   skip-check:
#     - CKV_AWS_XXX:RESOURCE_ID  # Justification for skipping this check
#
# OrganizationImagesBucket skips:
# This S3 bucket is intentionally configured for public read access to serve
# organization images (logos, photos). The bucket uses BLOCK_ACLS to prevent
# ACL-based public access while allowing bucket policy based public read.
# This is a deliberate design choice for serving static assets.
# Future improvement: Consider using CloudFront with OAC for better security and caching.
