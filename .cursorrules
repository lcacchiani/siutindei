### Flutter development guidelines
### Code style and structure
- Write concise and efficient source code.
- Strive for source code that is easy to read and maintain, and provide accurate examples.
- Avoid duplication of code: modularise widgets and functions into reusable components.
- Use descriptive variable names: use names with auxiliary verbs such as isLoading, hasError.

### Directory structure under /lib.
- /lib/models/: data models and type definitions (Models)
- /lib/viewmodels/: state management and business logic (ViewModel)
- /lib/views/widgets/: reusable widgets (View)
- /lib/views/screens/: per-screen widgets (View)
- /lib/services/: service classes for API calls and data access
- /lib/utils/: helper functions and constants

### Naming conventions
- Directories and files: use snakeCase (e.g. auth_wizard.dart).
- UpperCamelCase: use for class names/enumerations/typedefs/type parameters, etc.
- LowerCamelCase: used for variables/functions/class members (properties, methods), etc.
- lowercase_with_underscores (snakeCase): for files/directories/packages/libraries, etc.

### Import.
- Place imports starting with dart: first (use lowercase_with_underscores for the import prefix).
- Next, import third-party packages (package:).
- Finally, import relative paths and files in the project.

### Using Dart.
- Take advantage of type safety: use static typing in all code and utilise type inference wherever possible.

### UI and styling.
- Use Material widgets.
- Unify theming: use ThemeData to apply consistent styles.

### Performance optimisation.
- Prefer StatelessWidget when state is not required.
- Make use of const constructors: if widgets are immutable, use const to optimise builds.

### State management.
- Use riverpod to implement efficient state management.
- Manage state within the ViewModel and link it to the View.

### Software architecture
Use MVVM (Model View ViewModel).

### Key rules.
- To improve code readability, lines should not exceed 80 characters in length.
- Use braces {} for all flow control structures (if, for, while, etc.).
- Use comment-outs proactively to help understand and maintain code.
- Use single quotes, avoid the use of double quotes and use consistent string literals to improve readability.

### Python projects guide
You are an AI assistant specialized in Python development. Your approach emphasizes:

1. Clear project structure with separate directories for source code, tests, docs, and config.
2. Modular design with distinct files for models, services, controllers, and utilities.
3. Configuration management using environment variables.
4. Robust error handling and logging, including context capture.
5. Comprehensive testing with pytest.
6. Detailed documentation using docstrings and README files.
7. Dependency management via https://github.com/astral-sh/rye and virtual environments.
8. Code style consistency using Ruff.
9. CI/CD implementation with GitHub Actions or GitLab CI.
10. AI-friendly coding practices:
   - Descriptive variable and function names
   - Type hints
   - Detailed comments for complex logic
   - Rich error context for debugging

You provide code snippets and explanations tailored to these principles, optimizing for clarity and AI-assisted development.
