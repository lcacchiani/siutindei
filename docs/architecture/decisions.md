# Architecture Decisions

This document captures the agreed architecture decisions for the
Flutter mobile app, Next.js admin console, and AWS serverless backend.

## 1) Admin Web Router

**Decision:** Use Next.js App Router (React Server Components).

**Why:**
- Modern Next.js architecture (RSC, streaming, Suspense).
- Better performance and SSR defaults.
- Improved DX (layouts, loading, error boundaries).
- Best TypeScript support and forward compatibility.

**Canonical structure:**
- `apps/admin_web/src/app/...` with route groups and nested layouts.

## 2) Infrastructure as Code

**Decision:** AWS CDK (TypeScript) + CDK Pipelines.

**Why:**
- TypeScript-first IaC aligned with the frontend stack.
- Full AWS construct coverage and strong integration.
- Programmatic abstractions (loops, conditions, helpers).
- Self-mutating pipelines with approval gates and rollbacks.

**Canonical structure:**
- `backend/infrastructure/` contains CDK app, stacks, and pipeline.

## 3) CI/CD Authentication

**Decision:** GitHub Actions OIDC + IAM role assumption.

**Why:**
- No long-lived AWS keys stored in GitHub.
- Short-lived credentials with automatic rotation.
- Fine-grained IAM permissions and auditability.

## 4) Mobile Distribution

**Decision:** Android AAB + iOS App Store Connect/TestFlight.

**Why:**
- Google Play requires AAB for production.
- App Store Connect + TestFlight for production and beta.

**Notes:**
- CI uploads AAB to Play Console when service account secrets are set.
- Android signing uses a keystore injected at build time in CI.
- CI uploads IPA to TestFlight when App Store API keys are set.
- iOS signing uses Fastlane match with a private certificates repo.

## 5) Amplify Usage

**Decision:** Use Amplify for client SDKs and hosting where appropriate.

**Notes:**
- Amplify SDKs are used for auth/API integration on client apps.
- Infrastructure is provisioned via CDK for stronger control.
- Admin web hosting is triggered via GitHub Actions using
  `aws amplify start-job`.
- Promotions from staging to production are handled via the
  `amplify-promote` workflow.

## CI/CD Variables and Secrets

**GitHub Variables**
- `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID`
- `AWS_REGION`
- `CDK_STACKS` (optional)
- `CDK_BOOTSTRAP_QUALIFIER` (optional)
- `AMPLIFY_APP_ID`
- `AMPLIFY_BRANCH`
- `ANDROID_PACKAGE_NAME`
- `ANDROID_RELEASE_TRACK`
- `IOS_BUNDLE_ID`
- `APPLE_TEAM_ID`

**GitHub Secrets**
- `GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`
- `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64`
- `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`
- `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD`
- `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`
- `APPSTORE_ISSUER_ID`
- `APPSTORE_API_KEY_ID`
- `APPSTORE_API_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `MATCH_GIT_URL`
- `MATCH_PASSWORD`
- `FASTLANE_USER`
- `FASTLANE_APPLE_APPLICATION_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`

## Next Steps

1. Configure GitHub OIDC role in AWS and set org/repo variables.
2. Initialize CDK project under `backend/infrastructure`.
3. Bootstrap Next.js App Router admin app in `apps/admin_web`.
4. Configure Flutter release pipelines for AAB and iOS.
5. Configure Amplify app ID and branch variables for admin hosting.
6. Configure Android keystore and iOS match credentials.
