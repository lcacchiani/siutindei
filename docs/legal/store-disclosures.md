# Store privacy disclosures

Draft answers for the Google Play Data Safety form and the Apple App
Privacy questionnaire, derived from the Privacy Policy and the app's actual
data flows. Keep this file in sync with `docs/legal/README.md` whenever data
practices change.

## What the app actually collects

The app does **not** collect: location (search areas are user-selected

history outside the app, advertising identifiers. There are no ads and no
third-party analytics SDKs in the mobile app (web analytics are
consent-gated on the website only). No data is sold or shared for
advertising.

## Apple App Privacy (App Store Connect)

Privacy practices: "Data Linked to You"

- User Content → Other User Content — App Functionality (feedback,
  suggestions)

"Data Not Linked to You"

Tracking: the app does **not** track users across apps/websites owned by
other companies (no ATT prompt required).

The app is directed at parents and guardians (18+), not at children. It is
not a "designed for families" / kids-category app. Listings describe
children's activities but contain no personal data about children.
